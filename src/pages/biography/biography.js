      <h3 className={classes.subtitle}>Education and Experience</h3>
      <h3>
        Studied journalism and photography. Besides several works, Luiz was a

        and at the Social Service of Commerce / SESC-Rio.
        <br />
        <br />

        documentary images of popular samba in the city of Rio de Janeiro and
        Contos Fotogr√°fico (2014 Brazil / Austria), with stories and chronicles
        involving situations of photography in the lives of people.
        <br />
        <br />

        the series, Mashup (Chaos AD), where he exhibits in different countries

      <h3 className={classes.subtitle}>Considerations</h3>
      <h3>
        Luiz thinks beyond photography and he is very interested in new
        technologies to support his work. He produces for the existence of
        photographic art and culture.
        <br />
        <br />
        New works with innovations will arrive!
